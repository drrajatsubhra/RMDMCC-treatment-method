## Abstract
RMDMCC (Rajatsubhra’s Manual Dilatation Method for Congenital Constipation) is a novel, non-surgical technique for managing low-set Hirschsprung’s Disease in pediatric patients. The method utilizes **progressive manual dilatation of the anorectal segment**, combined with **long-term stool softening support** (e.g., polyethylene glycol or lactulose/lactitol), to gradually restore bowel function and avoid surgical intervention.  
Developed in a pediatric clinical setting over several years, RMDMCC has been successfully applied in numerous cases, demonstrating consistent functional improvement and reduced need for invasive procedures.

## Background
Low-set Hirschsprung’s Disease, a variant where aganglionosis is limited to the distal segment of the colon, can often be treated surgically. However, surgery carries inherent risks, postoperative complications, and psychological impact for both the patient and family.  

RMDMCC offers an alternative, aiming to:  
- Avoid hospitalization and major surgery.  
- Promote gradual expansion of the functional lumen.  
- Maintain patient comfort and family participation in the therapeutic process.

## Methodology Outline
1. **Diagnosis:** Based on clinical history, examination, and confirmed absence of higher-level obstruction.  
2. **Manual Dilatation:**  
   - Performed periodically by a trained physician.  
   - Gradual increase in dilator/finger size to promote progressive muscle and lumen adaptation.  
3. **Stool Softening Support:**  
   - Polyethylene glycol (PEG), lactulose, or lactitol syrup prescribed to maintain soft stool consistency.  
4. **Follow-up:**  
   - Regular assessment for stool frequency, ease of passage, and absence of abdominal distension.  
   - Family instructed in gentle abdominal massage and dietary measures.

## Advantages
- Avoidance of surgical trauma and postoperative complications.  
- Gradual, physiologically adaptive improvement.  
- Reduced treatment costs compared to surgery.  
- Can be applied in low-resource settings.  

---

## Limitations
- Requires patient/family compliance over several months.  
- Limited applicability in high-segment or total aganglionosis.  
- Not a replacement for surgery in severe cases.
